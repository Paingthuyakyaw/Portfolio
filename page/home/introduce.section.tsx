          <p>
            I am a Frontend Developer with over 3 years of experience and 1 year
            of experience as a Backend Developer. I specialize in building
            modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
            Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, as well as popular frameworks such as React.js, Next.js
            for frontend development, and Spring and Spring Boot for backend
            development
          </p>
          <p>
            specialize in creating seamless user experiences by focusing on
            performance, accessibility, and aesthetics. Over the years, Iâ€™ve
            collaborated with cross-functional teams and played an integral role
            in developing scalable and high-performing web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to frontend development, I also have experience in
            backend development using Spring and Spring Boot. I have built
            RESTful APIs, implemented secure authentication and authorization
            mechanisms, and worked with relational databases like MySQL and
            PostgreSQL. I am also familiar with deploying applications using
            tools such as Docker and GitHub Actions, and ensuring optimal
            server-side performance and scalability.
